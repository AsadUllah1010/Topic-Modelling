# Topic-Modelling
Topic Modelling means assigning topic labels to a collection of text documents. The goal of topic modelling is to identify topics present in the text documents.

# Introducrion
Topic Modelling is a Natural Language Processing technique to uncover hidden topics from text documents. It helps identify topics of the text documents to find relationships between the content of a text document and the topic. To identify topics of any text document, we need to use algorithms that can analyze the frequency of words to identify relationships between the content and topics. To solve this problem, we need to have textual data. I found an ideal dataset for this task. As we are working on a Natural Language Processing problem, we need to clean the textual content by removing punctuation and stopwords. we will use an algorithm to identify relationships between the textual data to assign topic labels. We can use the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm for this task. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a generative probabilistic algorithm used to uncover the underlying topics in a corpus of textual data.
